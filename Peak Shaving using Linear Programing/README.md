This note book contains the impelmentation of Peak Shaving using Linear Programing Mathematical Model defined in Paper ***Shaving Peaks by Augmenting the Dependency Graph***

Barth, L., & Wagner, D. (2019, June). Shaving peaks by augmenting the dependency graph. In Proceedings of the Tenth ACM International Conference on Future Energy Systems (pp. 181-191).

It uses ***Gurobi Optimizer*** to solve the Linear Programing Model for Peak Shaving
